## Core Modules

### MCP Gateway (mcp-gateway)

MCP Gateway is the core component of the system, responsible for handling all MCP protocol requests:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Request Processing" icon="globe">
    - **Unified Entry**: `/*` listens to all HTTP requests
    - **Route Distribution**: Dynamic request distribution based on route prefix
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protocol Conversion" icon="arrows-spin">
    - **Protocol Parsing**: Parse JSON-RPC format requests
    - **Tool Distribution**: Parse tool names and construct call parameters
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Main Functions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Routing">
    Request distribution based on route prefix and suffix (`/sse`, `/message`, `/mcp`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Protocol Parsing">
    Parse JSON-RPC format to extract methods and parameters
  </Step>
  <Step title="Service Invocation">
    Invoke external services and parse results
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration Reading">
    Dynamically load and apply configuration information
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Management Backend (web)

Provides a visual management interface with the following core modules:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Proxy Configuration Module">
    Used to configure MCP gateway proxies and tools, supporting graphical configuration interface
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="comments" title="Conversation Experiment Platform">
    Simple Chat for testing MCP, mainly provided for developers and users who need to integrate into custom systems for reference
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="User Management Module">
    User permissions, information maintenance, and access control
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Management Backend Service (apiserver)

Provides complete backend API services:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="API Services" icon="server">
    - Configuration management API
    - User interface management
    - Chat history queries
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configuration Management" icon="database">
    - Configuration write storage
    - Hot update notifications
    - Permission control
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Storage System

#### Configuration Storage

Stores all MCP services, tools, routing and other configuration information:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="SQLite" icon="database">
    Lightweight database, suitable for single-machine deployment and development
  </Card>
  <Card title="PostgreSQL/MySQL" icon="server">
    Production-grade databases, suitable for multi-node deployment
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Storage" icon="api">
    Enterprise-grade database, suitable for production environments
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Web Data Storage

Stores user data, session records, etc.:

- User account information
- Chat session history
- System configuration data
- Operation log records

### External Service Integration

MCP Gateway is designed for seamless integration with existing business systems:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="api" title="REST API Services">
    Supports standard REST API calls, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and other methods
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="webhook" title="Webhook Services">
    Supports Webhook callbacks and event trigger mechanisms
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Database Services">
    Can directly integrate with existing database systems, supporting multiple database types
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Reception">
    MCP Client sends requests to specified endpoints of MCP Gateway
  </Step>
  <Step title="Protocol Parsing">
    Gateway parses MCP protocol format and extracts tool invocation information
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration Lookup">
    Look up corresponding configuration information based on tool name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Service Invocation">
    Call backend services using configured templates and parameters
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response Processing">
    Process backend service responses and convert to MCP protocol format
  </Step>
  <Step title="Result Return">
    Return processing results to MCP Client
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deployment Architecture

### Single Machine Deployment

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="All-in-One Deployment" icon="box">
    All services run on the same machine, suitable for development and testing environments
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Distributed Deployment

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Microservice Architecture" icon="cubes">
    Each component is deployed independently, supporting horizontal scaling and load balancing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Containerized Deployment" icon="docker">
    Use Docker and Kubernetes for containerized deployment
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Extensibility Design

MCP Gateway adopts a modular design and supports the following extensions:

- **Protocol Extensions**: Support for new MCP protocol versions
- **Storage Extensions**: Support for new storage backends
- **Authentication Extensions**: Support for multiple authentication mechanisms
- **Monitoring Extensions**: Integration with various monitoring and logging systems

<Tip>
To deeply understand the specific implementation of each component, please refer to the corresponding configuration documentation and development guides.
