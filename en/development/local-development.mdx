This document describes how to set up and start a complete MCP Gateway development environment locally, including starting all necessary service components.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, please ensure your system has the following software installed:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Git" icon="git">
    Version control tool
  </Card>
  <Card title="Go 1.24.1+" icon="golang">
    Go programming language environment
  </Card>
  <Card title="Node.js v20.18.0+" icon="nodejs">
    JavaScript runtime environment (includes npm)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Project Architecture Overview

The MCP Gateway project consists of the following core components:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="server" title="apiserver">
    Provides API services for configuration management, user interfaces, etc.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="gateway" title="mcp-gateway">
    Core gateway service that handles MCP protocol conversion
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="flask" title="mock-server">
    Mock user service for development testing
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="browser" title="web">
    Management interface frontend
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Environment Setup Steps

### 1. Get Source Code

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork Project">
    Visit the [MCP Gateway code repository](https://github.com/amoylab/unla), click the `Fork` button to fork the project to your GitHub account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone Locally">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/unla.git
    cd unla
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Install Dependencies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Go Dependencies">
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Node.js Dependencies">
    ```bash
    cd web
    npm i
    cd ..
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Configure Environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Backend Configuration">
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Frontend Configuration">
    ```bash
    cd web
    cp .env.example .env
    cd ..
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can start development without modifying anything, using the default configuration. You can also modify configuration files to meet your environment or development needs, such as switching between Disk, DB storage methods.
</Note>

## Start Development Services

You need 4 terminal windows to run all services. This approach of running multiple services on the host machine allows for easy restart and debugging during development.

### Terminal 1: Start mcp-gateway

```bash
go run cmd/gateway/main.go
```

mcp-gateway will start by default on `http://localhost:5235` for handling MCP protocol requests.

### Terminal 2: Start apiserver

```bash
go run cmd/apiserver/main.go
```

apiserver will start by default on `http://localhost:5234`.

### Terminal 3: Start mock-server

```bash
go run cmd/mock-server/main.go
```

- mock-server will start by default on `http://localhost:5236`
- mock-server-sse will start by default on `http://localhost:5237`

### Terminal 4: Start web frontend

```bash
cd web
npm run dev
```

After running the command in the web terminal, it will display the access address.

## Access Management Interface

After startup is complete, you can access the management interface in your browser using the address shown in the terminal.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Default Login Information" icon="key">
    - Username: Determined by environment variable `SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME`
    - Password: Determined by environment variable `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
  </Card>
  <Card title="First Login" icon="user">
    After logging in, you can modify the username and password in the management interface
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common Issues

### Environment Variable Settings

Some services may require specific environment variables to work properly. You can set these variables in the `.env` file:

```bash
# Example environment variables
APISERVER_JWT_SECRET_KEY="changeme-please-generate-a-random-secret"
SUPER_ADMIN_USERNAME="admin"
SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD="changeme-please-use-a-secure-password"
```

### Port Conflicts

If you encounter port conflicts, you can modify port configuration in environment variables:

```bash
MCP_GATEWAY_PORT=5235
APISERVER_PORT=5234
MOCK_SERVER_PORT=5236
```

### Dependency Issues

If you encounter dependency installation issues:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="golang" title="Go Dependency Issues">
    ```bash
    go clean -modcache
    go mod tidy
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="nodejs" title="Node.js Dependency Issues">
    ```bash
    cd web
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    npm install
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Development Workflow

### Code Contribution Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Upstream Repository">
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:amoylab/unla.git
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sync Upstream Code">
    ```bash
    git pull upstream main
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Feature Branch">
    ```bash
    git switch -c feat/your-feature-name
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push After Development">
    ```bash
    git push origin feat/your-feature-name
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Pull Request">
    Create a Pull Request on GitHub to merge your branch into the main repository's main branch
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Branch Naming Conventions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="New Features" icon="plus">
    Use `feat/` prefix, such as `feat/add-auth-module`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bug Fixes" icon="bug">
    Use `fix/` prefix, such as `fix/memory-leak`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Development Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="test-tube" title="Testing">
    Before submitting a PR, ensure your code passes all tests
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="sync" title="Code Synchronization">
    Keep your fork repository synchronized with the upstream repository to avoid code conflicts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code" title="Code Standards">
    Follow the project's code standards and commit message format
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
