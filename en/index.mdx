## What is Unla?

**Unla** is a lightweight, highly available gateway service written in Go. It enables individuals and organizations to transform existing MCP services and APIs into [MCP protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) compliant services through configuration — without changing a single line of code.

<Note>
⚡ **Note**: Unla is under rapid development! We strive to maintain backward compatibility, but cannot guarantee 100%. Please carefully check version changes when upgrading. Due to rapid iteration, documentation updates may sometimes lag behind. If you encounter any issues, feel free to seek help through [Discord](https://discord.gg/udf69cT9TY) or [Issues](https://github.com/amoylab/unla/issues) ❤️
